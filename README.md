## Overview

### Your first assignment will start out with something fun - a game!

```
Thanks to the amount of logic there is in a game, there's no better app than a game to teach you how to think like a programmer!

Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges.



You will be working individually on this project.



As a reminder, Humber College has a zero-plagiarism policy - your project's code must be substantially yours. Do not copy code from similar projects or other sources. However, using lines of code from StackOverflow to accomplish general techniques/algorithms is okay - an example would be using StackOverflow as a source for code that replaces a character at a certain position in a string.


```

### Technical Requirements

```
Your App Must:
☐ Render a game in the browser.

☐ Include win/loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML. Popup alerts using the alert() method are okay during development but not production.

☐ Include separate HTML, CSS & JavaScript files.

☐ Have properly indented HTML, CSS & JavaScript. In addition, vertical whitespace needs to be consistent.

☐ No remaining dead and/or commented out code (code that will never be called).

☐ Have functions and variables that are named sensibly. Remember, functions are typically named as verbs and variables (data) are named as nouns.

☐ Be coded in a consistent manner. For example, choose between your preference for function declarations vs. function expressions.

☐ Deploy your game online using GitHub Pages so that the rest of the world can play your game!
